📖 Introduction
Traffic congestion is a major problem, especially when emergency vehicles get stuck at signals. This IoT-based Smart Traffic System detects emergency vehicles using RFID and adjusts signals dynamically based on traffic density measured by ultrasonic sensors.

✨ Features
✅ Emergency Vehicle Priority – Automatically turns signals green for ambulances using RFID detection.
✅ Real-Time Traffic Monitoring – Uses ultrasonic sensors to adjust signal timing based on traffic density.
✅ Arduino-Based Automation – Efficient, low-cost, and reliable microcontroller integration.
✅ IoT-Enabled Traffic Management – Can be extended for remote monitoring and control.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Arduino Mega & Arduino Nano – Main microcontroller units.
RFID Module (RC522) – Detects emergency vehicles.
Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) – Measures traffic density.
LED Traffic Lights – Simulates real-world traffic signals.

🔌 Hardware Requirements
Arduino Mega 2560
Arduino Nano
RFID Module (RC522) with Tags
Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) - 4 or more
LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) & Resistors
Jumper Wires & Breadboard

⚙️ Working Mechanism
Emergency Vehicle Detection (RFID):

Each emergency vehicle has an RFID tag.
When detected at an intersection, the traffic light turns green.
Traffic Density Detection (Ultrasonic Sensors):

Measures vehicle density at each signal.
Adjusts signal timing dynamically for smoother traffic flow.
🚀 Future Enhancements
✅ Integration with IoT & Cloud for real-time monitoring.
✅ Mobile App for remote traffic control.
✅ AI-based Traffic Prediction for better congestion management.
